    <p>The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors. Any big market is a bad choice, and a big market already served by competing companies is even worse. ... Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets.</p>
